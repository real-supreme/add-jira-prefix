You only need the `setup.sh` realistically to get started.

## Usage

```sh
sh setup.sh path/to/repo/directory
```

You can either download the repo or simply copy paste the setup.sh file and run it for the current git repo that's in your machine.

**If you're running the script in the repo's root file, then you can run the command as below:**
```bash
sh setup.sh .
```

## It wouldn't work if you have husky installed
Workaround:
TBD
